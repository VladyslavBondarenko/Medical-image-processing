### Task

* Determine the spatial position of pixel data of tomographic images
* Determine the three-dimensional coordinates of the image pixel, which is located in the specified row and column
* Print a text message with the pixel coordinates
* Display:
  * Coordinate axes with the origin at the isocenter of the scanner
  * Volume borders, which determines the series of tomographic images obtained during the study
  * Planes of the tomographic image
  * The position of the target pixel

| Rows | Columns | Pixel Spacing       | Slice Thickness | Spacing Between Slices | The coordinates of the pixel in the image plane |
